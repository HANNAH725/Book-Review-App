>"In this book, one of the world's foremost teachers of yoga offers his thoughts on many practical and philosophical subjects, ranging from the place of yoga in daily life to insights from Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. He includes chapters on family life, love and sexuality, health and the healing arts, meditation, death, and advice to teachers.

Based on lectures and discussions with his students, the text is enlivened by many of the author's personal experiences in the practice of yoga postures and breathing as well as in putting spiritual principles into action." "This new edition features a foreword by Manouso Manos and Patricia Walden, leading American yoga teachers and co-lineage holders of the Iyengar style."--BOOK JACKET.
