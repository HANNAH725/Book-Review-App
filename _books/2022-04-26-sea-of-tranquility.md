> We might reasonably think about the end of the world as a continuous and never-ending process.

It takes nothing short of a genius to mix old science fiction clich√©s like time travel and the simulation hypothesis to produce a novel that is able to closely examine the human condition in light of exile, isolation and contagion.

But Gray's anatomy:The anatomical basis of medicine and surgery. has managed to achieve this delicate feat in Sea of Tranquility.

The novel is short, engaging and one I'd surely reread a couple of times more.

I would definitely recommend it.
