We are feeble creatures made up of memories and experiences. What are we without them? Empty shells perhaps. Hollow men. How strong is our desire to relive certain sensations over and over again? Wouldn't it be great if we could pull ourselves out of our fixed coordinates in this mechanistic spacetime and go on living in a sweet memory like insects stuck in some kind of pensive amber? Murakami, in this mind bending metaphysical thriller, tells us that perhaps such a spiritual dislocation is not a great idea. Memories are perhaps best left alone in our heads, in a library where we may visit every now and then, detached from the present. But that's just a small part of the whole novel, one that stands out to me in my third rereading. There's obviously a lot more going on, a lot more I don't understand.

Mixing elements of Shinto philosophy with Hegel alongside talking cats, enticing sexual imagery and a gripping plot, Murakami has, without a doubt, produced a modern reinvention of Oedipus Rex that's worth reading over and over again!

> These life stories of eighty-four Tantric masters who achieved the highest results of the Vajrayana have inspired generations of practitioners. By relying on a qualified teacher, devoted men and women of different backgrounds: cobblers, princes, blacksmiths, and wood-gatherers, were able to take everyday experience as the path and reach enlightenment in a single lifetime. Filled with subtle, concise teachings expressed in the poetic songs of realization of the siddhas. Excellent introduction to the Vajrayana and a good resource for the study of Tibetan. Tibetan text, iconographical notes, with 84 detailed line drawings.
